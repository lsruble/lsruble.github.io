            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This project focused on developing an efficient system for automatic <strong>traffic sign detection</strong>, combining classical computer vision methods with <strong>machine learning techniques</strong>. The team successfully created a <strong>robust algorithm</strong> capable of identifying various types of <strong>road signs</strong> and <strong>traffic lights</strong>.
                The approach involved innovative data preprocessing, expanding the initial dataset from <strong>800 to 2300 signs</strong> through clever augmentation techniques. For classification, the team utilized <strong>Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)</strong> features, achieving high accuracy with <strong>SVM classifiers</strong>. The detection phase combined the <strong>MSER algorithm</strong> with a custom binary processing method, resulting in effective sign localization.</p>

            <p>Results were impressive, with the system achieving up to <strong>94.49% precision</strong> at a high confidence threshold. Notably, the algorithm demonstrated near <strong>real-time processing</strong> capabilities, analyzing about one image per second even on low-power hardware. This performance suggests potential applications in <strong>embedded systems</strong> and mobile devices.
                The project stood out, earning the <strong>highest marks</strong> in the course. While excelling in many areas, the team identified opportunities for future improvements, particularly in traffic light detection and performance under high-brightness conditions.
                Overall, this project showcased a successful fusion of classical computer vision and machine learning approaches, resulting in a <strong>robust</strong> and <strong>efficient traffic sign detection system</strong> with real-world potential.</p>
