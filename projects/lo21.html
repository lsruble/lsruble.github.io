            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>As part of an <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> course, I contributed to the development of a digital version of <strong>Schotten-Totten</strong>, a strategic card game for two players. Schotten-Totten challenges players to claim <strong>border stones</strong> by creating the strongest card combinations. My primary responsibilities in this project were implementing the <strong>game rules</strong> and developing the <strong>Qt-based graphical user interface</strong>.
                In the rules implementation, I ensured that all game mechanics were accurately translated into code, including <strong>card placement</strong>, <strong>combination strength evaluation</strong>, and <strong>border stone claiming</strong>. This required a deep understanding of both the game's logic and object-oriented programming principles. I also implemented the <strong>tactical variant</strong> of the game, which introduces special cards with unique abilities, adding an extra layer of strategy.</p>

            <p>For the Qt interface, I designed and developed an intuitive and visually appealing <strong>game board</strong> that accurately represents the physical game. This included creating interactive elements for <strong>card selection</strong>, <strong>placement</strong>, and <strong>border stone claiming</strong>. I also implemented <strong>game state visualization</strong>, allowing players to easily track their progress and strategize accordingly.
                This project not only enhanced my skills in <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> but also provided valuable experience in <strong>game logic implementation</strong> and <strong>GUI development</strong> using Qt. It demonstrated my ability to translate complex rule sets into functional code and create user-friendly interfaces for interactive applications.</p>
