            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>As part of my studies in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> and <strong>Industrial Computing</strong>, I developed a digital safe puzzle for an <strong>Escape Room</strong> experience. My primary focus was on programming and <strong>electronics</strong> for this interactive element.
            I used <strong>C++</strong> on an <strong>Mbed microcontroller</strong> to bring the safe to life. The programming involved creating a <strong>state machine</strong> to control the safe's overall functionality. I implemented handlers for the <strong>rotary encoder</strong> input and button confirmation. A clever audio feedback system was programmed to guide players towards the correct combination. Additionally, I integrated control systems for an <strong>electromagnetic lock</strong> and <strong>mechanical actuator</strong> to physically open the safe upon successful code entry.</p>

            <p>My role extended to designing and building a custom <strong>circuit board</strong> for the safe. The board interfaced with various inputs including a <strong>32-position rotary encoder</strong> and a confirmation button. Outputs included a <strong>buzzer</strong> for audio feedback, an electromagnetic lock, and a mechanical actuator. The circuit incorporated <strong>voltage regulation</strong>, signal conditioning, and <strong>PWM-based motor control circuits</strong>. I personally soldered and tested the final board to ensure its functionality.
            The safe utilized a <strong>three-digit combination</strong> system with automatic reset on incorrect entries. A subtle audio cue system using a buzzer indicated proximity to correct digits, adding an engaging element to the puzzle. I designed the <strong>PCB layout</strong> using KiCad and had it manufactured. The entire system was integrated with a <strong>Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)</strong> for overall Escape Room management.</p>

            <p>This project allowed me to apply and expand my skills in <strong>embedded programming</strong>, circuit design, <strong>PCB layout</strong>, and system integration. It provided valuable experience in <strong>hardware-software interfacing</strong> within a real-world application. The combination of software and hardware elements made this project particularly engaging and educational.</p>
